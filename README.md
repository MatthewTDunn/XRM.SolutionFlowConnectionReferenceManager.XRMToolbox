# XRMToolbox Plugin: Solution Flow Connection Reference Manager

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MatthewTDunn/XRM.SolutionFlowConnectionReferenceManager.XRMToolbox?style=flat-square)

## Overview

The **Solution Flow Connection Reference Manager** is a [XRMToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/) plugin developed to provide administrators and developers with a means to inspect & bulk reassign connection references on Power Automate flows. It is primarily designed to reduce the administrative burden of manually updating connection references from user-owned accounts to service principals or system accounts, aligning with governance best practices and organizational security policies.

Use this tool to:
- Audit connection references across multiple flows
- Efficiently reassign Power Automate Flow connection references within a solution or at an environment level

---

## Getting Started

- Open XRMToolBox and connect to a Dataverse environment
- Load this plugin from your local build or via the XRM Toolbox library
- Click the solution (or environment label if appropriate) you'd like to reassign
